# SODa WissKI-ISWC25 Bits

Develop and implement your data model 

From collection to diagram - understanding and explaining

Unit 2: Orientation - Overview of the workflow from data analysis to semantic modeling.

Duration: approx. 5 Min.


## From Data to Semantic Modeling – What We Will Do Today

Before we begin with modeling, let’s take a moment to understand the workflow that will guide us through today’s session.

In the humanities, GLAM institutions (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums), and research collections, we work with rich and complex data. Objects have histories, relationships, provenance, and meaning. Traditional spreadsheets often fail to express these connections—this is where semantic modeling becomes useful.

However, semantic modeling is not just technology—it is a methodological process. It requires thinking about meaning, context, and relationships. Today, we will explore how to connect domain knowledge with ontology-based data modeling in a practical way.

Today, we explore exactly that intersection of semantic expressiveness and practical modeling. 

WissKI is an excellent environment for this because it connects ontologies, domain knowledge, and data entry through a semantic path model. 

In other words: today is about building a bridge between knowledge organization and technical implementation.

## Workflow Overview

This is the workflow that will guide us through the tutorial today:

1. Analyze data – Understand data entities and relationships
2. Structure meaning – Identify concepts and properties
3. Model semantics – Map meaning to ontology (CIDOC CRM)
4. Create data paths – Build WissKI semantic paths and build a Pathbuilder
6. Evaluate & discuss – Reflect on the workflows and learning outcomes
