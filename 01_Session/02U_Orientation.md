# SODa WissKI-ISWC25 Bits

Develop and implement your data model 

From collection to diagram - understanding and explaining

Unit 2: Orientation - Overview of the workflow from data analysis to semantic modeling.

Duration: approx. 5 Min.


## From Data to Semantic Modeling – What We Will Do Today

Research data in the humanities, GLAM institutions, and cultural heritage is complex. We often work with rich contextual information that cannot be captured in flat tables or spreadsheets. Semantic technologies offer us a way to express these relationships and meanings more precisely — but they also introduce challenges:

* How do we balance theory and pragmatism?
* How can we design data structures that are both usable and sustainable over time?
* How do we model meaning without over-engineering?"

Today, we explore exactly that intersection of semantic expressiveness and practical modeling. 

WissKI is an excellent environment for this because it connects ontologies, domain knowledge, and data entry through a semantic path model. 

In other words: today is about building a bridge between knowledge organization and technical implementation.

## Workflow Overview

Here is the workflow that will guide us through the tutorial today:

1. Analyze data – Understand data entities and relationships
2. Structure meaning – Identify concepts and properties
3. Model semantics – Map meaning to ontology (CIDOC CRM)
4. Create data paths – Build WissKI semantic paths and build a Pathbuilder
6. Evaluate & discuss – Reflect on the workflows and learning outcomes
