# Develop and implement your data model 

From collection to diagram - understanding and explaining

## Welcome

Good morning and welcome to our tutorial **SODa WissKI–ISWC25 Bits: Ontology-driven Research Data Modeling** here at ISWC 2025 in Nara. 

My name is Canan, and I will guide you today through a hands-on exploration of WissKI, a virtual research environment for GLAM institutions and their collections.

My colleagues and I are members of the [SODa project team – sammlungen.io](https://sammlungen.io/projekt).

SODa is dedicated to advancing sustainable and interoperable infrastructures for the digital management, documentation, and publication of academic collections. It promotes and develops the data competencies necessary for research in and with scientific collections, fostering them in a transdisciplinary and practice-oriented way.

In Germany, more than 1,200 scientific collections exist at universities. They constitute a vital foundation for research-based knowledge production, disciplinary development, and academic teaching.

## Team Introduction

My colleagues are:

     </tr>
</table>

Together with my colleagues Gudrun and Mark, I developed this tutorial.

     </tr>
</table>

We were supported by Elias, who created a pipeline that converts draw.io diagrams into WissKI Pathbuilder XML files. 

This allows ontology-based application profiles to be generated automatically for WissKI, simplifying data entry while keeping the underlying semantic structure consistent.

## Objectives

This tutorial follows a learning-by-doing approach. 

**That means:** 

* Today we will not just talk about semantic modeling – we will actually model data together step by step. 
* We also believe in collaborative learning, so interaction will be part of our journey today.

**By the end of this tutorial, you will:**

* Understand ontology-based data modeling with WissKI.
* Analyze and structure domain collections.
* Build simple knowledge graphs and semantic paths.
* Use controlled vocabularies and authority data.
* Reflect on semantic modeling practices and challenges.

## Your Expectations and Experiences

Before we continue, I would like to hear from you. 

**What do you expect from this tutorial?**

</table>

* What do you expect to gain from this tutorial today?
* What brings you to ISWC 2025? What are you currently working on?
* What’s your experience with semantic modeling? 
* What challenges have you faced so far?

## Speed Dating Warm-Up

Now let’s get to know each other and connect a bit.

Time to wake up the room! 

We’re an international group here at ISWC, so let’s make some connections across cultures and backgrounds. 

**Please stand up for a quick speed networking round — don’t worry, it’s 100% geek-friendly and painless.**


**Activity: Connect & Share (5 Min.)**

1. Please find a person near you — ideally someone you haven't talked to yet.
2. You will interview each other using three quick questions.
3. Each round lasts only 30 seconds per person.
4. After each round: switch partners.
5. Then please go to another person.

**Questions to Ask Each Other**

* What’s your name and where are you from?
* Which languages do you speak?
* Tell me one fun fact about yourself – academic or random!


*Fun fact examples welcome: You once tried to model your kitchen in OWL, your dog is named 'SPARQL', or you collect vintage keyboards – everything counts!*

**Ready? Let’s go — starting with your first partner!**
