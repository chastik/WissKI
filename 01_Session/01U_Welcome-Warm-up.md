# Develop and implement your data model - From collection to diagram - understanding and explaining

## Welcome

Good morning and welcome to our tutorial **SODa WissKI–ISWC25 Bits: Ontology-driven Research Data Modeling** here at ISWC 2025 in Nara. 

My name is Canan, and I will guide you today through a hands-on exploration of WissKI, a virtual research environment for GLAM institutions and their collections.

My colleagues and I are members of the [SODa project team – sammlungen.io](https://sammlungen.io/projekt), which is dedicated to advancing sustainable and interoperable infrastructures for the digital management, documentation, and publication of university collections in particular. 

In Germany, more than 1,200 scientific collections at universities serve as important infrastructures for research, teaching, and knowledge transfer.

## Team Introduction

My colleagues are:

  </tr>
</table>

Together with my colleagues Gudrun and Mark, I developed this tutorial.

We were supported by Elias, who created a pipeline that converts draw.io diagrams into WissKI Pathbuilder XML files. 

This allows ontology-based application profiles to be generated automatically for WissKI, simplifying data entry while keeping the underlying semantic structure consistent.

## Objectives

This tutorial follows a learning-by-doing approach. 

That means: today we will not just talk about semantic modeling – we will actually model data together step by step. We also believe in collaborative learning, so interaction will be part of our journey today.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

* Understand ontology-based data modeling with WissKI.
* Analyze and structure domain collections.
* Build simple knowledge graphs and semantic paths.
* Use controlled vocabularies and authority data.
* Reflect on semantic modeling practices and challenges.

## Your Expectations and Experiences

Before we continue, I would like to hear from you. What do you expect from this tutorial?






## Speed Dating Warm-Up

Now let’s connect with each other and let us get to know each other. 
Okay, now let’s wake up the room a little! We’re an international group here at ISWC, so let’s connect across cultures and backgrounds. Please stand up for a quick Speed Dating round – no worries, it’s geek-friendly and painless.

**Activity: Connect & Share (5 Min.)**

1. Please find a person near you — ideally someone you haven't talked to yet.
2. You will interview each other using three quick questions.
3. Each round lasts only 30 seconds per person.
4. After each round: switch partners.
5. Then please go to another person.

**Questions to Ask Each Other**

* What’s your name and where are you from?
* Which languages do you speak?
* Tell me one fun fact about yourself – academic or random!


*Fun fact examples welcome: You once tried to model your kitchen in OWL, your dog is named 'SPARQL', or you collect vintage keyboards – everything counts!*

**Ready? Let’s go — starting with your first partner!**
