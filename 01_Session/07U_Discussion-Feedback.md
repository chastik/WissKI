# SODa WissKI-ISWC25 Bits

DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT YOUR DATA MODEL  
From collection to diagram – understanding and explaining  

Unit 7: Reflection & Conceptual Consolidation  

Duration: ~ 15 Min.

---

### Goal of this Unit
This session reflects on the **modeling process so far**. After moving from domain concepts to diagrams and implementing ontology structures in Protégé, we now pause to evaluate:

* what worked well
* what was challenging
* where uncertainties remain
* and how confident you feel moving forward into WissKI implementation

### Discussion Questions

* What was **easy** during modeling?
* What was **challenging**?
* Which **modeling decisions were difficult** and why?
* How did **CIDOC CRM help** – and where did it **cause confusion**?
* What **concepts are still unclear** before moving to WissKI?
* How does the **workflow** (Domain → CRM Mapping → Ontology → Protégé) feel:
  * *comprehensible*  
  * *manageable with practice*  
  * *overly complex*  
  * *still unclear*
* Are we modeling **objects** – or are we modeling **knowledge**?  
  (short philosophical turn)

### Application Scenarios – Open Reflection

* Where can you **apply** this modeling approach in your institution?
* Do you see **realistic use cases** in:
  * *research documentation*
  * *collection management*
  * *digital editions*
  * *knowledge graphs / LOD*
  * *provenance tracking*
* Do you see **OWL** as a technical language only – or as a **practical modeling tool**?
* Do you consider **Linked Open Data (LOD)** a relevant scenario for your work?
* Do you feel capable of **developing your own domain ontology** after today?

### Learning Feedback

* Were your **expectations met**?
* Which **aspects were most useful**?
* Which **topics need more explanation**?
* Which **skills improved** during the session?
* What should we **repeat, reduce, or expand** in future workshops?

> Optional **quick rating poll** (Mentimeter)
* Confidence in ontology modeling: ★☆☆☆☆ – ★★★★★  
* Confidence in Protégé: ★☆☆☆☆ – ★★★★★  
* Understanding CIDOC CRM: ★☆☆☆☆ – ★★★★★  
* Prepared for WissKI implementation: ★☆☆☆☆ – ★★★★★

### Quick Knowledge Check (Optional)

Short group quiz (verbal):
* What is the difference between a **domain concept** and a **semantic class**?
* Why do we use **E41 Appellation**?
* What is the purpose of **E89 Propositional Object**?
* When do we create **subclasses** in Protégé?
* What is a **semantic relationship**?
* .... other?
