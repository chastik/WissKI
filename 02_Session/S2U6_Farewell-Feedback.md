# SODa WissKI-ISWC25 Bits

**DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT YOUR DATA MODEL** 

From diagram to paths - explaining and applying

Unit 6: Farewell and Feedback

Duration: ~ 15 Min.

---

## Quick Feedback

This session reflects on the **modeling process so far**, let us discuss...

* What worked well ?
* What was challenging ?
* Where uncertainties remain ?
* Wnd how confident you feel moving forward into WissKI implementation ?

--

## Your Feedback is valuable

## ## Open Discussion Impulses

These are reflection questions for the group, best discussed together in plenary form.

---

### Understanding & Process

* What was your biggest *Aha!* moment today?
* What helped you understand the idea of **semantic modeling**?
* Did you feel a shift from a **data entry mindset** to **knowledge modeling**?

---

### Application to Real Projects

* Where can you apply this workflow in your work?
* Does this approach make sense in your institution or data context?
* Which part of your current projects would benefit from **explicit semantics**?

---

### Modeling Perspective

* What do you think is more challenging: **choosing classes** or **defining relationships**?
* How did your thinking change when moving from **concept map → ontology**?
* Do you see ontology as a **documentation method** or a **technical solution**?

---

### Motivation & Outlook

* Do you think **Linked Open Data (LOD)** is relevant for your domain?
* What would help you continue working with **semantic modeling**?
* Which area would you like to explore next:
  
  * ontology modeling
  * automation & pipelines
  * WissKI implementation
  * SPARQL querying / knowledge graphs
